#  Crouton

Crouton is a C++20 coroutine runtime library that provides some general purpose utilities, as well as cross-platform event loops, I/O and networking based on the [libuv][LIBUV], mbedTLS[MBEDTLS] and [llhttp][LLHTTP] libraries. (On Apple platforms it can also use the system Network.framework.)

A **Coroutine** is _a function that can return partway through, and then later be resumed where it left off._ Knuth wrote about them in the 1960s and they remained a curiosity for a long time, but they've since become widely used under the hood of the "async / await" concurrency model used in languages like JavaScript, C#, Rust, Nim, and Swift. Crouton brings this to C++.

Async/await gives you concurrency without the pitfalls of multithreading. You can write code in a linear fashion, "blocking" on slow operations like I/O (see the [example](#Example) below), but the thread doesn't really block: instead your (coroutine) function is suspended and some other function that's finished blocking can resume. When the I/O completes, your function is resumed transparently at the next opportunity.

How is that better than threads? It's safer and easier to reason about. The only places where concurrency happens are well-marked by the `co_await` and `co_yield` keywords. You don't need mutexes or atomic variables, and there are far fewer opportunities for race conditions or deadlocks. (There are performance benefits too: no expensive context switches, less stack usage.)

## Features

* General purpose utilities:
    * Useful coroutine base classes
    * `Generator`, an iterator implementation based on `co_yield`-ing values
    * `Future`, an asynchronous promise type
    * `CoMutex`, a utility that allows only one coroutine to enter at a time

* Event loops:
    * `Scheduler`, which manages multiple active coroutines on a thread
        * Round-robin scheduling of multiple active coroutines
        * Suspending a coroutine, then waking it when it's ready
        * Scheduling a function to run on the next event-loop iteration, even on a different thread
        * Scheduling a function to run on a background thread-pool
    * `Task`, an independently-running coroutine that can `co_yield` to give time to others
    * `Timer`, repeating or one-shot
    * `Actor`, a class whose coroutine methods are queued, never running concurrently
    
* Asynchronous I/O classes:
    * DNS lookup
    * File I/O
    * Filesystem APIs like `mkdir` and `stat`
    * Abstract asynchronous stream interface
    * In-process pipes
    * TCP sockets, with or without TLS
    * A TCP listener (no TLS support yet)
    * URL parser
    * HTTP client
    * HTTP server (_very_ basic so far)
    * WebSocket client and server
    
* Cross-Platform:
    * macOS (builds and passes tests)
      * iOS? ("It's still Darwin…")
    * Linux (builds; not yet tested)
      * Android? ("It's still Linux…")
    * Windows ("it oughta work…" but not yet built or tested)
    
## Status: ☠️EXPERIMENTAL☠️

This is very new code! So far, it builds with Clang (Xcode 14) on macOS, and GCC 12 on Ubuntu.

Test coverage is very limited.

APIs are still in flux.

## Example

```c++
// Simple HTTP client request:
HTTPConnection client("https://example.com");
HTTPRequest req;
HTTPResponse resp = co_await req.sendRequest(req);

cout << int(resp.status()) << " " << resp.statusMessage() << endl;

for (auto &header : resp.headers())
    cout << header.first << " = " << header.second << endl;

ConstBuf body;
do {
    body = co_await resp.readNoCopy();
    cout << string_view(body);
} while (body.len > 0);
cout << endl;
```

## Building It

> **Important:** Make sure you checked out the submodules! 
> `git submodule update --init --recursive`

### Prerequisites:

- CMake
- GCC, Clang or Xcode

#### on macOS:

- Install Xcode 14 or later, or at least the command-line tools.
- Install CMake; this is most easily done with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), by running `brew install cmake`

#### on Linux

    sudo apt-get install g++ cmake cmake-data`

### Building With CMake

    make all
    make test

The library is `libCrouton`, in the `build_cmake/debug/` or `build_cmake/release/` directory.

### Building With Xcode

**Before first building with Xcode**, you must use CMake to build libuv and mbedTLS:

    make xcode_deps

You only need to do this on initial setup, and after those submodules are updated.

Then:
- open crouton.xcodeproj
- Select the `Tests` scheme and Run. 
- To locate the binaries, choose Product > Show Build Folder In Finder
