#  Crouton ESP32 Tests / Example

This directory is an example project for using Crouton with the ESP-IDF embedded framework. You can build and run it with the usual `idf.py build flash monitor` invocation.

You may need to run `idf.py menuconfig` once to change settings in the `sdkconfig` file, such as details of the CPU type or serial port speed, if your board is different enough from the ESP32-S3 I use.
